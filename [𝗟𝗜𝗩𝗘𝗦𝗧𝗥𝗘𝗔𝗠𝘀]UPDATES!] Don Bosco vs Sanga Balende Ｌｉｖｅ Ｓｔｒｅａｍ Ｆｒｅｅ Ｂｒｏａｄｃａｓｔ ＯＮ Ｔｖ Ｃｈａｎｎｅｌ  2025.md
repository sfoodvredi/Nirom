The Don Bosco look to bounce back from a loss on Saturday night when they take on the Sanga Balende. The Don Bosco took the first game of the series on Thursday 10-6, but lost 8-1 on Friday and they are now 1-3 on the season. The Don Bosco scored the first run of the game in the top of the second, but gave up two in the bottom of the inning and trailed the rest of the game. The Don Bosco managed just three hits and Jameson Taillon gave up six runs in four and a third innings. The Don Bosco will give the ball to Shota Imanaga on Saturday as they look to clinch at least a series split with the Sanga Balende. Imanaga will be making his second start this season after he pitched against the Los Angeles Dodgers in Japan. The Don Bosco would lose the game, but Imanaga was great as he pitched four innings without giving up a hit. Imanaga is in his second season with the Don Bosco and he was great in 2025 as he went 15-3 with a 2.91 ERA.
