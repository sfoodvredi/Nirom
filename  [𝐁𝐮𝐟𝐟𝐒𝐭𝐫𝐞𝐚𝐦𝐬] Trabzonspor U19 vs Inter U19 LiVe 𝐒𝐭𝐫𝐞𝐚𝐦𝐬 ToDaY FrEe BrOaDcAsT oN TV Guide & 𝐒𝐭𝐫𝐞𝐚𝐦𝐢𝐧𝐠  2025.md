The Trabzonspor U19 look to bounce back from a loss on Saturday night when they take on the Inter U19. The Trabzonspor U19 took the first game of the series on Thursday 10-6, but lost 8-1 on Friday and they are now 1-3 on the season. The Trabzonspor U19 scored the first run of the game in the top of the second, but gave up two in the bottom of the inning and trailed the rest of the game. The Trabzonspor U19 managed just three hits and Jameson Taillon gave up six runs in four and a third innings.
