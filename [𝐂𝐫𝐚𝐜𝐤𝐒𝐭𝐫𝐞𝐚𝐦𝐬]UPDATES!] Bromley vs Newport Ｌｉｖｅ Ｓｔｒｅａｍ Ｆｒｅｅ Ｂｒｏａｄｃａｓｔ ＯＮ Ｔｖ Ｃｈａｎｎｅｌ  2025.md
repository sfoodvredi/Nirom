The Bromley look to bounce back from a loss on Saturday night when they take on the Newport. The Bromley took the first game of the series on Thursday 10-6, but lost 8-1 on Friday and they are now 1-3 on the season. The Bromley scored the first run of the game in the top of the second, but gave up two in the bottom of the inning and trailed the rest of the game. The Bromley managed just three hits and Jameson Taillon gave up six runs in four and a third innings. The Bromley will give the ball to Shota Imanaga on Saturday as they look to clinch at least a series split with the Newport. Imanaga will be making his second start this season after he pitched against the Los Angeles Dodgers in Japan. The Bromley would lose the game, but Imanaga was great as he pitched four innings without giving up a hit. Imanaga is in his second season with the Bromley and he was great in 2025 as he went 15-3 with a 2.91 ERA.
