The Gokulam Kerala W look to bounce back from a loss on Saturday night when they take on the Sethu W. The Gokulam Kerala W took the first game of the series on Thursday 10-6, but lost 8-1 on Friday and they are now 1-3 on the season. The Gokulam Kerala W scored the first run of the game in the top of the second, but gave up two in the bottom of the inning and trailed the rest of the game.
