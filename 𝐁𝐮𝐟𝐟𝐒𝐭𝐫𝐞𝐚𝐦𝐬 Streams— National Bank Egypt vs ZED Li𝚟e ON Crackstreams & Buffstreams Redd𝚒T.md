The National Bank Egypt look to bounce back from a loss on Saturday night when they take on the ZED. The National Bank Egypt took the first game of the series on Thursday 10-6, but lost 8-1 on Friday and they are now 1-3 on the season. The National Bank Egypt scored the first run of the game in the top of the second, but gave up two in the bottom of the inning and trailed the rest of the game.
